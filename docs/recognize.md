[# Object detection with deep learning and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/09/11/object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-opencv/)

When it comes to deep learning-based object detection there are three primary object detection methods that youâ€™ll likely encounter:

-   [Faster R-CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497) (Girshick et al., 2015) : complicated and slow, __~7fps__
-   [You Only Look Once (YOLO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) (Redmon and Farhadi, 2015) : very fast and not very accurate, __~40fps__
-   [Single Shot Detectors (SSDs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) (Liu et al., 2015) : compromise, more accurate, __~24fps__
